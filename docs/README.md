# Vocode Community Docs

Welcome to the `docs` folder of the **Vocode Community** repository! This folder contains the Markdown source files for the official documentation of **Vocode**, an open-source project.

## ðŸ“– Where to Find the Documentation

While you can browse the Markdown files here, we strongly recommend visiting the official, built, and deployed version of the documentation for the best experience:

ðŸ”— **[Official Vocode Documentation](vocode-docs.netlify.app)**

The deployed site provides an easy-to-navigate interface, search functionality, and proper formatting that is not available in raw Markdown files.
