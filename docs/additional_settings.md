This page allows you to customize various aspects of Vocode's behavior, including note display, notifications, recording settings, and text entry options.

## General Settings

### Full Note Previews
Toggle whether note previews appear as a single line or show their full content by default. When enabled, notes will display in their entirety in list views.

### Allow New Lines in Notes
Enable or disable line breaks within notes. When enabled, you can include paragraph breaks and other formatting that uses new lines in your notes.

### Auto-Delete Dismissed Notes
Control how long dismissed notes are kept before being permanently deleted. Use the slider to select a duration between 1-12 weeks.

## Voice Entry Settings

### Note-ifier
Choose how you're notified when notes are changed:
- **OFF**: No notifications
- **NOTIF**: System notifications
- **TOAST**: In-app toast messages

### Max Recording Duration
Set the maximum length for audio recordings. Use the slider to select a duration between 5-125 seconds, or set to âˆž for unlimited recording time.

## Text Quick Entry Settings

### Apply Transformers
**(Premium Feature)** When enabled, any text transformers you've configured will automatically be applied to notes created using text quick entry.

### Pre-dismiss Note
When enabled, items added using text quick entry will automatically be marked as dismissed. This helps keep your active notes list clean while still capturing information.
